### SQL Intermediate(1)
* `CASE WHEN`

---


```python
import sqlite3
%load_ext sql
%sql sqlite:////Users/jisu/Dropbox_Carl/Dropbox/JISU/Data/Jupyter_Projects/blog/data_engineer/sql/3_intermediate_sql/database.sqlite
```




    'Connected: @/Users/jisu/Dropbox_Carl/Dropbox/JISU/Data/Jupyter_Projects/blog/data_engineer/sql/3_intermediate_sql/database.sqlite'



---

### CASE WHEN
* `CASE WHEN`을 `WHERE` 안에 넣어 filter 할 수 있음
    * 이때, `IS NOT NULL`을 통해 그 이외의 조건들 제외 가능
* `CASE WHEN`을 Aggregate function 안에 넣어 aggregate된 데이터를 산출 할 수 있음


```sql
%%sql
SELECT
	 season
	,date
	,home_team_goal
	,away_team_goal
FROM Match
WHERE 
	CASE WHEN home_team_api_id = 8633 AND home_team_goal > away_team_goal 
		 	THEN "Barcelona wins in Home"
		 WHEN away_team_api_id = 8633 AND away_team_goal > home_team_goal 
		 	THEN "Barcelona wins in Away"
		 END IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 3;
```
