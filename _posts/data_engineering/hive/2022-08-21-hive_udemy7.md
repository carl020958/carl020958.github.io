### Sort
* order by
* sort by
* distribute by
* cluster by

---

### order by
* uses single reducer to do the full sorting of data
* used with limit often since one single reducer is used(데이터가 너무 많으면 시간이 너무 오래 걸리기에)

```sql
select * 
from ordering
order by col2
limit 5;
```

---

### sort by
* uses multiple reducer 
	* overall sorting is not done
	* 즉, 각 reducer 안에서만 sorting이 이루어짐

```sql
set mapreduce.job.reduces=2; -- 2개의 reducer로 set

select * 
from ordering 
sort by col2
limit 5;
```

### distribute by
* distribute the 'key:value' pairs amongst the reducers
	* 즉, 특정 value들이 특정 reducer에 모이는 것임
	* 따라서 실제 sorting을 위해서는 distribute by + sort by를 해야 함

```sql
select * 
from ordering 
distribute by col2 
sort by col2;
```

---

### cluster by
* distribute by + sort by

```sql
select * 
from ordering 
cluster by col2;
```
