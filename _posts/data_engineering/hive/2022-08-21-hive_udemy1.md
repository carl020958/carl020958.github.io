</p>

#### Driver
* fechtes the required APIs needed for the query that are modeled on JDBC & ODBC interfaces
* convert the Hive query into MR program from the help for the Compiliier

#### Compiler
* convert the Hive query into MR programs
* does semantic analysis of the program
* generates a execution plan with the help of a metastore

#### Metastore
* database storing all the structured information of the tables, partitions, number of columns in the tables, column data types, serializers, deserializers, etc
* by default Hive uses built-in Derby SQL server as metastore, not used in production since it provides single process storage(can't run two simultaneous instances of Hive CLI)

#### Execution Engine
* connected with Hadoop
* executes a plan created by the compiler 
* interact with the resourcemanager & namenode to fetch desired output data from the HDFS
