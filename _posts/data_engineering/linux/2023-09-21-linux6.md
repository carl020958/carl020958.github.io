### Verifying Network Connection
* Telnet
* Netstat

### Telnet

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install telnet
#telnet {ip} {port}
telnet naver.com 80
```

---

### Netstat
* `-a`: Shows all current active TCP connections and the ports on which the computer is listening.
* `-r`: Displays the routing table for your computer. This is the same as using the route print command.
* `-n`: Display active network connections and their status without resolving hostnames or port names.
* `-t`: shows tcp protocol
* `-u`: shows udp protocol
* `-p`: Display all active connections for the specified protocol. The protocols can be TC, UDP, ICMP, and IP.

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install net-tools

# see whether port is in use
netstat -an | grep {port}

# shows port and program listening to TCP
netstat -nlpt
```
