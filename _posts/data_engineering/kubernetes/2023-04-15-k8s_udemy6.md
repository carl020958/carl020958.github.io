### Service & Service Types
* `Service`: a stable address for pods(i.e an endpoint that is consistent so that other things(in and outside the cluster) can access it)
  * pods don't have a DNS name automatically when created, needs to create a service on top of them
  * CoreDNS resolve services by name
* There are different types of services
  * ClusterIP
  * NodePort
  * LoadBalancer
  * ExternalName

### Service Types
#### ClusterIP
* default
* Single, internal virtual IP allocated
* only reachable from within cluster(nodes & pods)
  * one set of pods connecting to other set of pods
* pods can reach service via apps port number

#### NodePort
* allows connection outside the cluster through the IP address of the nodes
* high port allocated on each node
* port is open on every node's IP
* Other pods need to be updated to this port

#### LoadBalancer
* controls a LB endpoint external to the cluster
* only available when infra porvider give a LB(e.g. AWS ELB, etc)
  * mostly used in the cloud
* created NodePort + ClusterIP services, tells LB to send to NodePort

#### ExternalName
* used less often
* not about inbound, rather for outbound
* adds CNAME DNS record to CoreDNS only
* Not used for Pods, but for giving pods as DNS name to use for something outside k8s
