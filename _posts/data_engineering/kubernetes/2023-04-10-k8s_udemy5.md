### Inspecting Kubernetes Object
* logs
* describe
* Recreation of Pods

---

### logs
```bash
# get running pods
kubectl get pods

# get container logs(kubectl logs deployment/{de}})
kubectl logs deployment/my-apache
# kubectl logs deployment/my-apache -f --tail 1 (there are many more options)

# not working!
# get logs of the container sharing the same label using selector(kubectl logs -l run={label name}})
# possible since kubectl run command automatically adds a label(the name of the deployment) to all the pods 
# can get logs from only up to 5 pods, so a third-party logging system is recommended for production
# kubectl logs -l run=my-apache
```

---

### describe
```bash
# all pods
kubectl describe pods

# describe specific pods
kubectl describe pods my-apache-6f45bc5bd9-4vvw9
```

---

### Recreation of Pods
```bash
# watch pods in runtime
kubectl get pods -w

# delete pods(kubectl delete pod {pod_name})
kubectl delete pod my-apache-6f45bc5bd9-4vvw9

# don't forget to delete the remaining deployment for experiment
# kubectl delete deployment my-apache
```
