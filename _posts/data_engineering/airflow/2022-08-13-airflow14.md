### Concurrency 설정
* `parallelism = 32`/ `AIRFLOW__CORE__PARALELISM`
  * defines the maximum number of task instances that can run in Airflow per scheduler
  * by default, execution up to 32 tasks are possible at the same time. 
  * if there are 2 schedulers: 64 tasks(2 x 32) are possible at the same time
  * the value here depends on the resources and the number of schedulers running.
* `max_active_tasks_per_dag = 16` / `AIRFLOW__CORE__MAX_ACTIVE_TASKS_PER_DAG`
  * defines the maximum number of task instances allowed to run concurrently in each DAG
  * By default, execution up to 16 tasks at the same time for a given DAG across all DAG Runs is possible.
* `max_active_runs_per_dag = 16` / `AIRFLOW__CORE__MAX_ACTIVE_RUNS_PER_DAG`
  *  defines the maximum number of active DAG runs per DAG
  *  by default, execution up to 16 DAG runs per DAG running at the same time is possible.
