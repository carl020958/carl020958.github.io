### Git Rebase
* Git Rebase


---

### Git Rebase
* Alternative to `git merge`
  * Rebasing re-writes the history of the commits so that the branch begins at the tip of the main(master) branch
  * In short, it deletes the 'muddied merge commits' and makes the commit log cleaner
  * Do not rebase commits that have been shared with others, (i.e. commits on the master), unless it is celar that other people did not include those commits
* Cleanup tool

```bash
# git rebase {main}
git switch feat/branch
git rebase main

# when merge conflicts happen follow the instructions given
# it usually includes the following steps
# resolve conrflicts & git add 
# then git rebase --continue
```
