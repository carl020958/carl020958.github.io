### Git diff
* Reading git diff
* Viewing Unstaged Changes
* Viewing Staged Changes
* Viewing Working Directory Changes
* Viewing Specific File Change
* Comparing Changes Across Branches
* Comparing Changes Across Commits

---

### Reading git diff
* Typically shows changes between one file
* Every line that is changed is marked with either + or -
* Lines that begin with - come from file A(usually the old version)
* Lines that begin with + come from file B(usually the new version)

```bash
#diff --git a/test.py b/test.py # same file test.py
#index 81d3d1s..f3c1324 13423 # meta data(don't need to care)
#--- a/test.py # to a - symbol is assigned
#+++ b/test.py # to b + symbol is assinged
#@@ -3,4 +3,5 python 
#print(1)
#print(2)
#print(3)
#-print(4)
#+print(5)
#+print(6)

# * @@ -3,4: from file A(-) starting from line 3, shows 4 lines (from print(1) to print(4))
# * @@ +3,5: from file B(+) starting from line 3, shows 5 lines (from print(1) to print(6) execept print(4))
```

### Viewing Unstaged Changes
* Lists the changes in the working directory that are not staged for the next commit

```bash
# compares staging area and the working directory and shows "unstaged changes"
git diff
```

---

### Viewing Staged Changes
* Lists only the changes between the staging area and the last commit

```bash
# compares staging area and last commit and shows "staged changes"
git diff --staged
git diff --cached
```

---

### Viewing Working Directory Changes
* Lists the changes in the working directory after the last commit(HEAD)
* Shows the combination of unstaged & staged changes

```bash
# compares HEAD and the working directory and shows "all unstaged and staged changes" since HEAD
git diff HEAD

# compare one parent above of HEAD with HEAD
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
git diff HEAD~1 # same as above
```

---

### Viewing Specific File Change

```bash
# show changes(staged) in one file
git diff --staged test.txt

# show changes(unstaged & staged) in two file
git diff HEAD test1.txt test2.txt
```

---

### Comparing Changes Across Branches
* Order between the commits matters, the previous one will have the - symbol

```bash
# show changes between branches git diff [branch1_name] [branch2_name] or git diff [branch1_name]..[branch2_name]
git diff main test_branch
git diff main..test_branch

# show change between branches of only one file git diff [branch_name] [branch2_name] [file_name]
git diff main test_branch test.txt
```

---

### Comparing Changes Across Commits
* Order between the commits matters, the previous one will have the - symbol

```bash
# show changes between commits git diff [commit1_hash] [commit2_hash] or git diff [commit1_hash]..[commit2_hash]
git diff 324d23 5243d2
git diff 324d23..5243d2

# show change between commits of only one file git diff [commit1_hash] [commit2_hash] [file_name]
git diff 324d23 5243d2 test.txt
```
