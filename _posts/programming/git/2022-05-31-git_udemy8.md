### Git Switch & Fecth & Pull
* Remote Tracking Branches
* Git Switch
* Git Fetch
* Git Pull

---

### Remote Tracking Branches
* Where the branch was pointing at the time the user last communicated with the remote repository
* The pattern is `{remote}/{branch_name}` 
  * e.g. `origin/master`

```bash
# view the remote branches the local repository knows about
git branch -r

# move to the branch where the remote tracking HEAD is pointing to (git checkout {remote}/{branch_name})
git checkout origin/master
```

### Git Switch
* Create new local branch from the remote branch of the same name & set up to track the remote branch(link the branch with the remote branch)
* It is possible to move to the branch with `git checout {remote}/{branch_name}`
  * But in this case, it will be a `detached HEAD`

```bash
# git switch {branch_name}
git switch feat/branch_name

# same as above(git checkout --track {remote}/{branch_name})
git checkout --track feat/branch_name
```

### Git Fetch
*  Fetching allows us to download changes from a remote repository
* However, those changes will not be automatically integrated into the working files
* In Short, `git fetch {remote}`retrieves the latest information from remote repository(e.g GitHub) but doesn't affect the working files

```bash
# git fetch {remote}, if remote is not specified origin is the default
git fetch origin
# same as above
git fetch

# fetch as specific branch (git fecth {remote} {branch})
git fetch origin feat/branch_name

# go to that branch(in a 'detached HEAD' state)
git checkout feat/branch_name
```
