---

### Semantic Versioning
* Standardized versioning system for software releases
* Consist of Three Digit (e.g. 2.4.1)
  * Major Release(e.g. 2)
    * Significant changes that are no longer backwards compatible.
    * Features may be removed or changed substantially
  * Minor Release(e.g. 4)
    * New features or functionality have been added but is still backwards compatible
    * The new functionality is optional and should not force users to rewrite their own code
  * Patch Release(e.g. 1)
    * Does not contain new features or significant changes
    * Typically signify bug fixes and other changes that do not impact the the code is used

---

### Viewing Tag

```bash
# view all tags
git tag

# filter by pattern(git tag -l "{pattern}")
git tag -l "*beta*" # contains beta
git tag -l "v1.0.0" # is exactly v1.0.0
```

---

### Checking Out Tag
* Same as checking out to a specific commit

```bash
#checkout(git checkout {tag})
git checkout v1.0.0

# Comparing between two tags(git diff {tag1} {tag2})
git diff v1.0.0 v1.0.1
```

---


### Lightweight Tag
* Single Name/label of a particular commit

```bash
# create lightweight tag(git tag {tagname})
git tag v1.0.0
```

---


### Annotated Tag
* Stores extra meta data including author's name, email, date, and tagging message etc.

```bash
# create annotated tag(git tag -a {tagname})
git tag -a v1.0.0

# see the message of the tag
git show v1.0.0
```

---


### Tagging Previous Commit

```bash
# tag previous commmit(git tag {tag_name} {commit_has})
git tag v1.0.0 234s3s
```

---

### Forcing and Deleting Tag
* Tag names cannot be duplicated

```bash
# force a tag to switch to another commit(git tag -f {tagname} {commit_hash})
git tag -f v1.0.0 234s3s

# delete a tag(git tag -d {tag_name})
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

---

### Pushing Tags
* By default, `git push` doesn't transfer tags to remote servers.

```bash
# push all tags to remote server
git push --tags

# push single tag(git push {remote_name} {tag_name})
git push origin v1.0.0

```

### Deleting Remote Dag
```bash
# delete tag(git push origin :refs/tags/{tag_name})
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```
