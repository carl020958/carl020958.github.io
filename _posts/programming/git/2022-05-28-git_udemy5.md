### Git stash
* Needs for Stash
* Git Stash & Pop
* Multiple Stashes
* Dropping & Clearing Stashes

---

### Needs for Stash
* When wanting to switch to another branch when there is an uncommitted changes on the current branch: two possibilities
  * conflict exists: changes come to the switched branch
  * conflict unexists: Git will tell to commit or stash
* Stash can be used to switch over to another branch while not commiting(but saving the changes of) the changed files

---

### Git Stash & Pop
* Git stash: Take all uncommitted chnages(unstaged & staged) and stash them, reverting the changes in a working copy
* Git pop: Take the changes that were in the stash, pop them off and add them to the working directory/staging area

```bash
# stash
git stash
git stash save # same as above

# do whatever needed like git switch and commit etc.

# pop
git stash pop
```

---

### Git Stash Apply 
* Apply whatever is stashed without removing it from the stash
* Useful when wanting to apply the stashed changes to multiple branches
* Conflicts can occur which needs to be solved

```bash
# apply
git stash apply
```

---

### Multiple Stashes
* Stashes will stack when stashing multiple times

```bash
# view stash list
git stash list

# apply specific stash git stash apply stash@{[number]}
git stash apply stash@{2}
```

---

### Dropping & Clearing Stashes

```bash
# drop specific stash git stash drop stash@{[stash_id]}
git stash drop stash@{2}

# clear all stashes
git stash clear
```
