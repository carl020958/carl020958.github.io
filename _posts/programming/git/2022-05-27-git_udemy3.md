### Git Branch
* View Branch
* Create Branch
* Delete Branch
* Rename Branch
* Merge Branch

---

### View Branch

```bash
# view existing branches
git branch
```

---

### Create Branch
* It is important where you branch from
  * could branch from master/main or another branch
* If there is a staged file when switching branches, it must be commited or stashed before switching
* If there is a untracked file when swithcing branches, it follows to the switched branch

```bash
# create new branch git branch {branch_name}
git branch test

# change to another branch git switch {branch_name}
git switch test

# make & switch with one go
git switch -c test

# git checkout does the same thing with million of additional things # git checkout {branch_name}
git checkout test

# make & switch with one go
git checkout -b test
```

---

### Delete Branch
* Must be not on the branch to delete

```bash
# delete branch(after merged) git branch -d {branch_name}
git branch -d test

# delete branch by force git branch -D {branch_name}
git branch -D test
```

---

### Rename Branch
* Must be on the branch to rename

```bash
# rename branch git branch -m {branch_name}
git branch -m main
```

---

### Merge Branch
* Merging is done on branches, not specifc commits
* Merge is always done to the current HEAD branch

#### Fast-forward Merge
* There are two branch master & test branch
  * test branch is based on master and master branch is behind few commits compared to test branch
* From git's perspective, the pointer(HEAD) just has to catch up a few commits forward
* After merging the two branches are not synchronized

```bash
# switch to the destination branch(master branch) that needs merging
git switch master

# merge branch git merge {branch_name}
git merge test
```

#### Non Fast-foward Merge without conflict
* There are two branch master & test branch
  * test branch is based on master and there is a new commit on master branch that test branch does not include(and there is no conflict, meaning that other changes were made to the same file)

```bash
# switch to the destination branch(master branch) that needs merging
git switch master

# merge branch(commit message pops up)
git merge test
```

#### Non Fast-foward Merge with conflict
* There are tree branch master, test1 and test2 branch
  * test1 and test2 branch is based on master and on each branch there is a commit that made a different change to the same file(there is a conflcit)

```bash
# make a new branch to resolve & include the two branch
# from test2
git branch -c combo

# conflict is done when trying to merge
git merge test1

# open & edit the file(s) with merge conflicts
# have to remove the conflict markers(below) in the document
#<<<<<<< HEAD
#=======
#>>>>>>>
# can select among the four choices in VSC
# modifying is also possible

# add changes and make a commit
git add .
git commit
```
