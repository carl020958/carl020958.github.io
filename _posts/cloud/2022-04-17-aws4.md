### AWS S3
* S3 Overview
* Buckets
* Objects
* Versioning
* Encryption

---

### S3 Overview
* S3 is a ”infinitely scaling” storage
* Store objects(files) in buckets(directories)
* Versioning

---

### Buckets
* Buckets must have a globally unique name & are defined at the region level
* Naming Convention for a bucket
  * No uppercase
  * No underscore
  * 3-63 characters long
  * Not an IP
  * Must start with lowercase letter or number

---

### Objects
* Objects(files) have a Key
* The **key** is the **FULL path**
  * s3://my-bucket/**my_file.txt**
  * s3://my-bucket/**my_folder1/my_folder2/my_file.txt**
* The key is composed of prefix + object name
  * s3://my-bucket/**my_folder1/my_folder2/my_file.txt**
  * prefix: my_folder1/my_folder2
  * object name: my_file.txt
* There’s no concept of directories within buckets, it's just keys with very long names that contain slashes
* Object values are the content of the body
  * Max Object size is 5TB
  * If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
* Each Object can have Metadata, Tags, and Version ID
  * Metadata: List of text key / value pairs(system or user metadata)
  * Tags: Unicode key / value pair – up to 10(useful for security / lifecycle)
  * Version ID: if versioning is enabled

---

### Versioning
* Can version files in S3
* Enabled at the bucket level
* Same key overwrite will increment the version
* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version null
* Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

---

### Encryption
* SSE-S3: Encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
  * Encryption using keys handled & managed by Amazon S3
  * Object is encrypted server side
  * AES-256 encryption type
  * Done by setting header as "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
* SSE-KMS: Leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
  * Encryption using keys handled & managed by KMS
  * KMS Advantages: user control + audit trail
  * Object is encrypted server side
  * Done by setting header as "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
* SSE-C: When wanting to manage own encryption keys
  * Server-side encryption using data keys fully managed by the customer outside of AWS
  * Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key
  * HTTPS must be used
  * Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made
* Client Side Encryption
  * Client library such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
  * Clients must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3
  * Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving from S3
  * Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
